DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:


Here is a description for each of the plots shown in the images (`output1.png`, `output2.png`, `output3.png`, `output4.png`) based on their content. You can use this for your GitHub README to explain the visualizations generated in your Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`).

## 📊 Project: Linear Programming - Production Optimization

This project demonstrates how to apply **Linear Programming** techniques to a **production optimization** problem using Python and matplotlib for visualization.

### 📁 Files Overview

---

### 📌 `output1.png`: Constraint Lines

This plot displays the **constraint lines** for the Linear Programming problem:

* Each line represents a constraint such as resource limitations (like labor hours or material).
* The **blue** and **green** lines represent linear inequalities that define the feasible region.
* These lines are the foundation for constructing the feasible solution space.

---

### 📌 `output2.png`: Feasible Region

This figure shows the **feasible region**:

* Formed by overlapping the areas that satisfy all constraints.
* The **shaded area** (in gray) represents the region where all constraints are satisfied.
* Only the points inside this region are considered for optimal solutions.

---

### 📌 `output3.png`: Optimal Solution Point

This image marks the **optimal solution**:

* A **red dot** indicates the point that gives the **maximum profit** or desired objective value.
* This point lies on the boundary of the feasible region where the objective function reaches its optimal value.

---

### 📌 `output4.png`: Profit Lines with Feasible Region

This visualization overlays **profit lines** on top of the feasible region:

* The dashed lines represent different levels of profit (e.g., \$300, \$400, \$500).
* The optimal profit line is marked and aligned with the **red dot** from `output3.png`.
* Clearly shows how moving along the profit lines within the feasible region helps find the best result.
